# Azul Arc Full stack machine test

This project has been made using React + Express + NodeJS + MongoDB, I have used github codespaces for the coding environment.

The backend lives inside the backend folder in the main repo along with all the routes and API's. Currently it allows connections from anywhere (CORS: *).

You cannot clone this repo and directly run the code as the MongoDB connection URI and other .env files are with me and not committed to the repository,
I am attaching a video demo of the entire project. Let me know if there are any questions/concerns.
